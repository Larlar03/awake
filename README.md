# Awake
Awake is a website I made for a client. After continuous communication, I helped them to figure out what the purpose of their site was, and was able to create a project brief that allowed me to design an develop a site that fit their needs and communicated their service clearly.

The site is fully responsive, and was one of my first time using Bootstrap components and Sass. I used Bootstrap for the mobile navigation, buttons and testimonial carousel. I also used a third-party contact form and added a Google captcha.
