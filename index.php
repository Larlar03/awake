              brilliant SAT results and he got to go to prom. No matter how dark your days get remember if you make
              it through the night the sun will always rise again in the morning. Thank you Awake.</p>

            <p>Tremendous respect for the support you gave. So happy to report how amazingly different his education
              is. Itâ€™s like having a new child who has an amazing relationship with his teachers and continues to
              thrive and develop. I can only
              advise parents to not fear change a fresh start really does overcome educational obstacles.</p>

            <p>I can honestly say it can be
              very daunting going through authorities procedures especially if you don't have the relevant training. I felt
              alone and scared almost like I was backed into a corner but with the support of Awake things seem a
              lot less stressful. I want to say a big massive thank you for your help and I would recommend this
              service
              to anyone.</p>

            <p>There comes a time in your life when you need help from an
              understanding person with the specific set of tools for that particular job. Jalika has
              the historical wisdom for the task on hand and she executes her expertise with purpose,
              courtesy and professionalism. I can whole-heartedly recommend Awake as an organisation that
              puts clients both first and at the heart of their interventions.</p>

            <p>Thank you so much for your help yesterday, your presence not only gave me strength but also made a huge
              impact. I hope this teacher continues to acknowledge my son's autism traits as
              this will help my son tremendously. I wasn't sure if I got off track but thanks to you he let me explain
              about my son's routine and behaviour and now he does have some insight.</p>
